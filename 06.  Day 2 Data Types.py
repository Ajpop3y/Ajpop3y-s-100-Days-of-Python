Write a program that adds the digits in a 2 digit number. e.g. if the input was 35, then the output should be 3 + 5 = 8

two_digit_number = input()
first_digit = int(two_digit_number [0])
second_digit = int(two_digit_number [1])
print(first_digit + second_digit)
# note [] gets the character in the index position stated by the number in the square brackets for any string.
# In a list,it gets the item at the index position stated.
